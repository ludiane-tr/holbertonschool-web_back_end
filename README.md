# ES6 Basics

This project aims to learn and practice the new features introduced by ECMAScript 6 (ES6). Each task focuses on a specific ES6 concept or feature.

## Tasks to Complete

1. **Const or let?**  
   Modify the `taskFirst` and `taskNext` functions to use `const` and `let` respectively, instead of `var`.

2. **Block Scope**  
   Learn and understand the scope of variables declared with `let` and `const`, and how they behave within blocks.

3. **Arrow Functions**  
   Refactor traditional functions into arrow functions for cleaner and more concise code.

4. **Parameter Defaults**  
   Implement default parameters in functions to provide default values when no arguments are passed.

5. **Rest Parameter Syntax for Functions**  
   Use the rest parameter syntax (`...`) to collect a variable number of arguments in a function.

6. **The Wonders of Spread Syntax**  
   Learn how the spread syntax (`...`) works for unpacking elements from an array or object into a new array or object.

7. **Take Advantage of Template Literals**  
   Use template literals for string interpolation and multi-line strings.

8. **Object Property Value Shorthand Syntax**  
   Simplify object property declarations using shorthand syntax when property names are the same as variable names.

9. **No Need to Create Empty Objects Before Adding Properties**  
   Learn how to directly add properties to objects without initializing them as empty.

10. **ES6 Method Properties**  
   Refactor object method definitions using ES6 method shorthand syntax.

11. **For...of Loops**  
   Understand and implement the `for...of` loop to iterate over iterable objects like arrays and strings.

12. **Iterator**  
   Explore how iterators work in ES6 and how to create your own iterable objects.

13. **Let's Create a Report Object**  
   Create an object that generates a report of some data, demonstrating your understanding of ES6 features.
